# Table Ready

## Description 

This is a web portal built for [Table Ready](http://www.tableready.net) that allows restaurant managers to efficiently manage their restaurantsâ€™ waitlist, reservations, information, customers, and employees with ease.

We aim to facilitate restaurant managers to efficiently manage their restaurant and maintain communication with their customers.
